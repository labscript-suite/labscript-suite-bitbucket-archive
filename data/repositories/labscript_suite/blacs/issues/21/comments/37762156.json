In short, the current device tabs are supposed to directly represent the hardware (a good manifestation of this is the fact that channels show up in BLACS even if they aren't in your connection table).\n\nHowever, I do understand the usefulness of having an inverted digital controls for shutters. It has been a long term aim to create virtual devices; tabs in BLACS that do not correspond to a specific device but instead draw controls from one or more devices. Implementing this, along with the ability to create a control that represents the labscript subclass (aka a Shutter) I think would be the best approach. It maintains a view of the hardware (device tab) if you need that, but also allows you to create customised  views that represent something else (like all MOT controls and the digital lines are represented as open/close buttons when they are shutters).\n\nThis wouldn't be too hard to implement I think.
