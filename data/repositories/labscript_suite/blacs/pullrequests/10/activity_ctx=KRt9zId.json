Now things are responsive. Added a \"retry now\" button for retrying unsent shots, reduced the timeout time for connecting to lyse to 1 second instead of 2, and decreased the periodic connectivity checks to once every 10 seconds, instead of every second when not connected.\r\n\r\n- Shrank connection table notification recompile button to just say \"recompile\" instead of \"recompile connection table\". The message next to it already makes it clear what's being recompiled.\r\n\r\n- Made unexpected queue exceptions be raised in a thread so that they are still visible, even though the queue continues on.\r\n\r\n- Used a QGridLayout for the queue part of the main interface to make things a bit better aligned.\r\n\r\n(by the way, I've checked the option \"close feature2 after the pull request is merged\". When merging, bitbucket gives the merger the option of changing this to not close the branch. Please do close the branch. Perhaps counterintuitively, re-using branches like I'm doing is easier if they are closed every time.)\r\n\r\n![blacs_elision.png](https://bitbucket.org/repo/9pKE7ad/images/1351085268-blacs_elision.png)", "title": "Prevent GUI from jumping around, pixel saving, analysis submission improvements", "destination": {"commit": {"hash": "a5d306dab61e", "type": "commit", "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/labscript_suite/blacs/commit/a5d306dab61e.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/labscript_suite/blacs/commits/a5d306dab61e"}}}, "repository": {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/labscript_suite/blacs.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/labscript_suite/blacs"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/bytebucket.org/ravatar/{50ed1eb9-8c1b-4afe-a8b8-8e0a33b39a05}ts=249915"}}, "type": "repository", "name": "BLACS", "full_name": "labscript_suite/blacs", "uuid": "{50ed1eb9-8c1b-4afe-a8b8-8e0a33b39a05}"}, "branch": {"name": "default"}}, "reason": "", "source": {"commit": {"hash": "4e1e8f206364", "type": "commit", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/cbillington/blacs/commit/4e1e8f206364"}, "html": {"href": "#!/cbillington/blacs/commits/4e1e8f206364"}}}, "repository": {"links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/cbillington/blacs"}, "html": {"href": "#!/cbillington/blacs"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/bytebucket.org/ravatar/{1ffc697c-0cdc-43c3-b124-343fa9d9cc95}ts=python"}}, "type": "repository", "name": "BLACS", "full_name": "cbillington/blacs", "uuid": "{1ffc697c-0cdc-43c3-b124-343fa9d9cc95}"}, "branch": {"name": "feature2"}}, "state": "OPEN", "author": {"display_name": "Chris Billington", "uuid": "{e363c5a9-5075-4656-afb5-88bd6a6dceeb}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7Be363c5a9-5075-4656-afb5-88bd6a6dceeb%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7Be363c5a9-5075-4656-afb5-88bd6a6dceeb%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9238baf7300c41c0e7294db922899e6ad=httpsavatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.netinitialsCB-1.png"}}, "nickname": "cbillington", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:cbf1bc43-1dc2-477b-9e25-1a8f40fd7ee3"}, "date": "2017-06-18T23:14:12.509022+00:00"}, "pull_request": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 10, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/labscript_suite/blacs/pullrequests/10.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/labscript_suite/blacs/pull-requests/10"}}, "title": "Prevent GUI from jumping around, pixel saving, analysis submission improvements"}}]}
