I'll put the extra detail back in then, with manual linebreaks to make it not be likely to elide. The elision still works with multiline, it just puts the \"...\" in themiddle of one side rather than next to the actual lines of text. The GUI will still jump as the label grows in size, but since the queue will be paused it will stay there until the user does something, so that's fine I think. Another alternative is to grow an error pulldown thing like that tabs have.\n\nOk, thanks for the points about h5 and hdf5! Rep-generating code assumes the files end with .h5 though, and not hdf5. As does a lot of code elsewhere I think. So if I make it accept .hdf5 as well as .h5, then problems will still come up if files end in .hdf5. Shot files are (most of the time) generally generated by runmanager, which imposes .h5, but the user could still make a file that doesn't end in that. Should we just make it error on files that don't end in .h5? \"sorry, I know it's an hdf5 file but we need to be able to make assumptions about extensions, please make your files end in .h5\"\n\nThanks for the comments, and thanks for the testing Shaun!", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Ah good point about the error messages.
