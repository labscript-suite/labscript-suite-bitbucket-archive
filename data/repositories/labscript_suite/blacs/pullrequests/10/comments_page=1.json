In Windows, the border around the tab itself is quite light compared with the border around the tab contents. This makes it less obvious that the status bar is part of the tab.

This means that I can't test the multi-line stuff.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I think that the status bars on tabs may be slightly too narrow now, they look a bit weird without some extra whitespace above the text.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Not really related to changes made here, but the interface in general, it looks as though various borders look different on our computer compared with yours. In Windows, the border around the tab itself is quite light compared with the border around the tab contents. This makes it less obvious that the status bar is part of the tab.
