Would it make sense to disable sending for analysis when in this mode? I imagine you might leave the experiment on repeat and wait for your atom number to stabilise, or the cloud to move to a particular position as the experiment warms up, so you'd probably want to send to lyse, do some fits, then plot the values you care about over time. In this case, it'd make more sense to let lyse do the deleting once it had finished with the h5 file and had the calculated quantities to plot stored in its dataframe.\n\n* Does this work in both repeat modes? Do you ever use it in \"repeat all\" mode, or just in repeat last? If used in \"repeat all\" mode, does it keep n copies of each individual file being repeated?\n\n* I assume that you often want to keep more than 1 (or 0?), otherwise it'd be easier to just have the option to simply repeat a single experiment and delete the file each time, which could just be a 3rd option in the dropdown.\n\n", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>A few questions, mostly just to understand how you guys are using this functionality over there:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>How does lyse cope with shots being deleted once they've been loaded?
