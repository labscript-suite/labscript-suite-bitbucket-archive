I originally was a sloppy coder importing `*` all over the place, then I tightened up and started importing explicitly. But now, I realise that because Qt comes from C++ where namespacing is less of a thing (is it even a thing at all?), the Qt names basically never clash with anything, they all start with 'Q', and I never remember which submodule they're from anyway, so importing `*` has saved a lot of having to look up which module things are in.\n\nSo I really don't mind if we're importing `*` or not - I think the only downside is that static analysis tools like linters are less able to detect errors in your code if you `import *`. This is a pretty good reason, and I'd like to use tools like that more often, so if someone made a pull request to get rid of the `*` imports I would vote to accept it.
