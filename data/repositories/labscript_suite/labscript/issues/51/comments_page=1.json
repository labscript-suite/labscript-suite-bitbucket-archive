It\u2019s not that the Novatech is enforcing it\u2019s clock limit on the digital flag, but that the interaction between the clockline for the novatech and the clockline for the digital flag must be taken into account when determining the set of instructions for the pseudoclock.\n\nIn your example in the other thread, you are attempting to change a digital flag 40us after a call to update the Novatech.
