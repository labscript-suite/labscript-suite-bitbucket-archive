We're just trying to make it *consistently* 100 nanoseconds plus 100 microseconds plus jitter, by making the pulseblaster's falling edges come 100 nanoseconds after the rising ones.\n\nThis is what the existing setup in the lab I'm in does, and we are trying to emulate that on one hand. On the other hand, the correct solution if one wants to make this better isn't to make labscript produce falling edges earlier \u2014 it's to use synchronous updating.
