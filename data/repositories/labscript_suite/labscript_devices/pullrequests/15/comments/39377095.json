I ended up using a different workaround to overcome the bus speed and DAQmx bug problems simultaneously by reading two edges at once for each pulse, but it requires a larger alteration to work. \n\nAnyway, closer inspection shows that the wait monitor pulse duration is not being set to 0.1s like the comment on line 95 claims it should. I'm guessing the code that does that is external to this device class?
