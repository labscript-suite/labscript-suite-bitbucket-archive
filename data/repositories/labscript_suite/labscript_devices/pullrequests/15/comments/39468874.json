PFI0 on the other hand is an example of how you would specify which terminal to use to clock analog input - presently NI DAQmx acquisition in labscript works by acquiring data at all times, self-clocked by the NI device's internal timing, but it would be nice to be able to acquire only at specific times based on clock ticks. This functionality isn't implemented yet, but the idea would be to set it with the `mode_AI` keyword argument - with 'labscript' being the current way things work, and 'gated' and 'triggered' using PFI0 either as a gate or as a clock for acquisition.
