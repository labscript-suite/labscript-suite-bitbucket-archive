Using less than the full sensor can increase frame rate, reduce the size of data files, and (through the increased frame rate) reduce noise from vibration/thermal sources during imaging. The images would still need a data processing ROI, which could be defined in BIAS or Lyse, for fitting.\n\nYou can see how I'm using the acquisition ROI in [pull request #26 for labscript_utils](#!/labscript_suite/labscript_utils/pull-requests/26/feature-pycapturecamserver/diff)", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>The acquisition ROI is intended to complement, rather than replace, the data processing ROIs used by BIAS or Lyse.
