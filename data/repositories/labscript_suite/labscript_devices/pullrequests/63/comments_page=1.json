To solve this, I think there is a reset function - I would guess that would set all the attributes back to default. Might be worth running that during transition_to_manual, so long as it is not as slow as initiating communication with the camera in the first place (which takes several seconds). If that works how I think it does, then we could be perfectly sure that each shot runs exactly as specified without any non-default settings from previous shots remaining.</p>", "type": "rendered"}, "created_on": "2019-04-17T15:32:00.277984+00:00", "user": {"display_name": "Chris Billington", "uuid": "{e363c5a9-5075-4656-afb5-88bd6a6dceeb}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7Be363c5a9-5075-4656-afb5-88bd6a6dceeb%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7Be363c5a9-5075-4656-afb5-88bd6a6dceeb%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9238baf7300c41c0e7294db922899e6ad=httpsavatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.netinitialsCB-1.png"}}, "nickname": "cbillington", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:cbf1bc43-1dc2-477b-9e25-1a8f40fd7ee3"}, "updated_on": "2019-04-17T15:32:00.289864+00:00", "type": "pullrequest_comment", "id": 99173457}, {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/labscript_suite/labscript_devices/pullrequests/63/comments/99594828.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/labscript_suite/labscript_devices/pull-requests/63/_/diff#comment-99594828"}}, "deleted": false, "pullrequest": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 63, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/labscript_suite/labscript_devices/pullrequests/63.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/labscript_suite/labscript_devices/pull-requests/63"}}, "title": "IMAQdxCamera"}, "content": {"raw": "I\u2019m happy to merge as is pending review of the UI features, but this is would be better done by someone who has a camera to test with.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>I\u2019m happy to merge as is pending review of the UI features, but this is would be better done by someone who has a camera to test with.</p>", "type": "rendered"}, "created_on": "2019-04-23T06:50:43.234681+00:00", "user": {"display_name": "Russell Anderson", "uuid": "{6c12ac6e-1980-466d-86fe-6c163bd116c2}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7B6c12ac6e-1980-466d-86fe-6c163bd116c2%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7B6c12ac6e-1980-466d-86fe-6c163bd116c2%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "https://avatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.net/557058:443e4cd1-86c9-4cd5-8034-22bab14d9d1e/e307ce36-5fb6-4418-8090-b9e533eab225/128"}}, "nickname": "rpanderson", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:443e4cd1-86c9-4cd5-8034-22bab14d9d1e"}, "updated_on": "2019-04-23T06:50:43.248201+00:00", "type": "pullrequest_comment", "id": 99594828}, {"links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/labscript_suite/labscript_devices/pullrequests/63/comments/99732324.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/labscript_suite/labscript_devices/pull-requests/63/_/diff#comment-99732324"}}, "parent": {"id": 99594828, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/labscript_suite/labscript_devices/pullrequests/63/comments/99594828.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/labscript_suite/labscript_devices/pull-requests/63/_/diff#comment-99594828"}}, "depth": 1}, "deleted": false, "pullrequest": {"type": "pullrequest", "id": 63, "links": {"self": {"href": "data/repositories/labscript_suite/labscript_devices/pullrequests/63.json"}, "html": {"href": "#!/labscript_suite/labscript_devices/pull-requests/63"}}, "title": "IMAQdxCamera"}, "content": {"raw": "Thanks Russ, I\u2019m pretty happy with it too, but since I\u2019m going to be using it in the coming days I\u2019ll wait to see if any bugs come up before merging.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Thanks Russ, I\u2019m pretty happy with it too, but since I\u2019m going to be using it in the coming days I\u2019ll wait to see if any bugs come up before merging.</p>", "type": "rendered"}, "created_on": "2019-04-23T21:30:45.231281+00:00", "user": {"display_name": "Chris Billington", "uuid": "{e363c5a9-5075-4656-afb5-88bd6a6dceeb}", "links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7Be363c5a9-5075-4656-afb5-88bd6a6dceeb%7D"}, "html": {"href": "https://bitbucket.org/%7Be363c5a9-5075-4656-afb5-88bd6a6dceeb%7D/"}, "avatar": {"href": "data/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9238baf7300c41c0e7294db922899e6ad=httpsavatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.netinitialsCB-1.png"}}, "nickname": "cbillington", "type": "user", "account_id": "557058:cbf1bc43-1dc2-477b-9e25-1a8f40fd7ee3"}, "updated_on": "2019-04-23T21:30:45.239987+00:00", "type": "pullrequest_comment", "id": 99732324}], "page": 1, "size": 7}
