If the latter, are requests for absolute position changes potentially wrong if the device has not been homed? If so, then we should have an option to always home the device at worker startup, to ensure positions are accurate. The docs don\u2019t seem to be full of warnings about potential inaccuracy of setting absolute positions, so it looks like its not a problem, but I would like to verify it.  \n  \nEdit: [Potentially might be a problem](https://www.zaber.com/manuals/T-LS):\n\n> When operating manually, you should home the device by retracting it completely every time you disconnect or turn off the power. You will not be able to achieve the maximum travel until you have homed the device or sent a command to tell the device its current position. After the device retracts completely it will stop automatically and you can turn the potentiometer clockwise to move the device. If you have a model without a potentiometer, you cannot control the device manually. Instead you must connect the device to a computer and issue a home instruction.\n\n\u200c", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>It looks to me like all devices support the binary protocol.
