Not supressing them makes mose sense honestly, but I needed some way to detect loss of focus (focusOutEvent doesn't seem to be called).\n\nIf I simply don't handle the leaveEvents - just delete the leaveEvent method completely - everything is fine for me in PyQt4. However, in PyQt5, I have one remaining problem - if you click and drag outside the application, and then press another mouse button (say you right click whilst not releasing the left mouse button), then the origin tabBar doesn't get a mouseRelease event (even if you subsequently release the mouse) - it only gets a leaveEvent. So handling that leaveEvent was important for ensuring the drag was cancelled in that case.\n\nHowever, since if you do this, you are clicking on the floating tab, perhaps i can make the floating tab detect the extra mousePressEvent and use that to cancel the drag (I could keep the drag going but that would be too much work - should just cancel it if the user is doing funky things with their mouse).\n\nHonestly this looks like a bug in Qt - really it should make up its mind - either keep delivering mouse events to the original widget, or if you're going to start delivering them somewhere else, please send the original widget a focusOutEvent so that it knows it's never going to see the mouseRelease event.
