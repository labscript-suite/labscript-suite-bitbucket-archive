Could you confirm the licence for the new dependency `PyCapture2` (both the Python wrapper and the C API). Is it compatible with the BSD (as in can code that uses it be licensed under the BSD licence?). If it is GPL or LGLP, we may need to put this in a separate project rather than within labscript_utils (although if it was only the C API that is GPL, then my understanding is license compatibility may depend on how you interact with the C API).\n\nChris Billington (as you probably know) is not available to review at the moment, but I'm inclined to just merge once the above is resolved as it's entirely new, standalone code and bugs can be reported and fixed as needed (even if something is broken, it's not going to affect many people initially!)", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi Daniel,</p>\n<p>Thanks for the pull request!
