This may have been because the tab bar size and its container's size are not the same in macos (presumably because of the centring of the tabs), whereas they are the same in linux and windows.

This makes no difference on Windows and linux but hopefully fixes your problem.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>I can easily make it scroll one tab-width, which seems sensible (and is what Qt itself does).
