The problem just as @cbillington said is that the dataframe isn't updated.\nI am currently running a empty singleshot routine to update and yes is is quite slow. \nI guess the change I proposed would be faster and solve the problem of the user having to mark all shots as not done.\n\nAnother idea, to reduce the read and write operations and increase speed, could be upon saving results to the h5 file also creating a array, that is then added to the dataframe at the end of the routine. This would eliminate all read operations for the dataframe update. This kind of change could also bring a speed increase to singeshot routines.", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Well @shaunj 's idea of saving it to the individuals I allready implemented.
