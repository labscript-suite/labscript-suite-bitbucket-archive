Probably should give it a better name.\n\nWhilst it's easy to tell if a routine is running from within lyse or not, the distinction I was getting at was that multishot routines can get information about a running lyse instance even if they are running from outside it, because the user calls lyse.data() (potentially specifying a hostname other than localhost), which connects to a running lyse instance and returns the dataframe. Whereas a singleshot analysis routine running outside lyse does not make contact with lyse. So what I was getting at is that it's possible to ensure multishot routines outside of lyse also inform lyse about changed data, whereas it is not so easy with a singleshot analysis routine, since it does not make contact with lyse and lyse is not necessarily even running. But I think we should probably just not support keeping the lyse interface updated when running routines outside lyse.
