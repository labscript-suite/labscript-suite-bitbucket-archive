I tried to track it down but it wasn't immediately obvious (I think it is to do with the call to `Plot.ui.adjustSize()` though in analysis_subprocess.py) \r\n\r\n* The first run of a script sets the plot window size. I think we should have the ability to unlock the window size to match the specifications of the last run of the script. This should be trivial to do once the above issue is resolved (as I think we just need to call `Plot.update_window_size()` after the script runs when we want the plot window to resize itself)\r\n\r\nImplementing the above would greatly aid the aim of producing publication quality plots (that need no further editing) from within the lyse GUI.
