I'm pretty sure I did the \"wait until first paint\" thing for a reason - I think paint events are low priority and deferred until after all other events are processed, or something like that. If things are still good in lyse then it's probably because lyse isn't doing much when you load routines, whereas runmanager does a lot when it loads stuff and so you notice the delay. Also whether paints happen first or not might be platform dependent. I would have been developing on Windows when I wrote that bit of runmanager.\n\n2. I think yeah, the two features are almost orthogonal. It seems like there are two use-cases for saving and loading config. The first is just restarting lyse and wanting everything back the way it was - this would entail loading the shots. The second is loading the analysis routines but wanting to run them on whatever new shots are going to come in. Perhaps shots/dataframe should be saved when the config is saved, but not laoded when it's loaded, and there could be save/load shots buttons above the FileBox to load and save shots - with one of the options of \"loading\" being \"load the shots that were saved when the config file was saved\" or whatever.

There's labconfig - it's designed to be user-editable and can contain configuration for any program.\n\n2. There's the saved configurations of apps, the ones that are savable and loadable by user action - i.e. they can select them from a file open dialog. But they are not designed to be user editable.\n\n3. And there's data that apps save automatically, that they don't give you the option to save and load. These are not designed to be user editable, or user selectable from a file open dialog. In fact it would be bad to have them in the same place as the user-savable configs because they could be accidentally selected in place of one. They should be sort of hidden in the filesystem, except that you still want them \nto be deleted upon uninstalling the labscript suite, so they should still go in the labscript suite folder. @pstarkey does BLACS have save data like this presently?\n\nSo I tentatively propose the following:\n\n1. labconfig stays in `/labconfig`. User-editable settings for programs like what port to have programs use remains here, so there is still per-app configuration in each app's section of the config file. Basically app settings that are global and not supposed to be editable while the program is running (not proposing any change, just describing how it is and agreeing it should stay that way).\n\n2. User saved configurations go in `/userlib/app_saved_configs/<app_name>`, with the code creating it if it doesn't exist. This should be the default folder whenever a user goes to save anything from an app, and nothing should be put here that is not user-initiated (though I'm sympathetic to saving certain data without asking for confirmation after the user has initially saved a configuration). This is for settings that can be modified whilst a program is open and that you might concievably want to have multiple different configurations of that you can switch between.
