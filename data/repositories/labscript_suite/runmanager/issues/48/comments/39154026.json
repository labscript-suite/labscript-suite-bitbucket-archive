In order to have per-shot feedback, I'm going to have to introduce requests from BLACS saying \"My queue is empty now, please compile and send me the next shot!\" or perhaps \"I have only one more shot in my queue, please compile and send me the next shot\" if you want to \"pipeline\" with a buffer of one shot to ensure the compilation isn't decreasing your duty-cycle (at a cost of the feedback only taking effect the shot after next rather than the next shot).\n\nIf I do this, then the runmanager compile queue will gain a \"repeat final\" mode just like the BLACS queue - and perhaps will simply inherit the setting from BLACS and not have its own (or perhaps vice-versa) - in which case you'd get the functionality you want, including avoiding producing a backlog in the BLACS queue.\n\nSo implement what you like to solve your immediate problem, but I think it's unlikely to make it into the mainline if you made a pull request. In which case you needn't make it be a quality implementation, if it's going to be superseded!\n\nAlthough I've been juggling all the pull requests coming in lately and the push for Qt5 support, my priority with labscript development otherwise has been to make the JQI  fork and mainline converge, which would entail this feedback business and a compilation queue for runmanager. So that's just a way of saying that it's a priority - I can't even use mainline labscript in my own lab until it's done!\n\nSo if the 3rd party pull requests calm down, as it looks like they will, I'll have more time to move things along with getting the JQI features into mainline, and this is next on the list!", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>Hi Kevin,</p>\n<p>Whilst you're free to implement something quickly to get this working for your purposes, this functionality would also be provided by my plans to add a \"compile queue\" to runmanager.
