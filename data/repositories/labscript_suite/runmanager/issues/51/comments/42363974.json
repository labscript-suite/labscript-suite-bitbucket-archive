I was running the 64 bit version of Python on a 64 bit Windows machine. When I tried to run \n\n```\n#!python\nfrom PyQt5 import QtGui, QtCore, QtWidgets\n```\nin a Python interpreter, it gave an error that the DLL load failed. To fix it, I uninstalled and reinstalled Anaconda2 and it currently seems to work. I suspect that when I downloaded Anaconda the first time, I clicked the automatic version, rather than the \"64-Bit Graphical Installer (500 MB)\" version. Perhaps I did not have a 64 bit version of PyQt5.\n\nNow that PyQt5 works, I can open all the programs except for blacs, which is giving an error \"IOError: Unable to open file (Unable to open file: name = 'c:\\experiments\\example_experiment\\connectiontable.h5', errno = 2, error message = 'no such file or directory', flags = 0, o_flags = 0)\" When I navigate to the folder, it has only blue_mot.h5, gen2.h5, and a folder named example. Perhaps I am also missing something simple here?
