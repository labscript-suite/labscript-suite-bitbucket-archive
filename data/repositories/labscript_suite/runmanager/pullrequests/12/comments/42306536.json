There is also no indication except the cursor on what digit will get edited. I aim to fix them later today. I'd be interested if besides those 2 problems there is anything else that should still be changed. \n\nUpdate: found some more bugs and fixed them and the leading zeros bug. Also reduced the code by a few lines. Will look into indicating current digit now. \n\nUpdate2: didn't find anything simple and short and also think the cursor should be indication enough.
