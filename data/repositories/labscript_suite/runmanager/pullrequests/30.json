Since this setting already exists, this change won't break existing setups, which have it set already.</p>\n<p>The pre-set <code>filename_prefix_format</code> in newly installed labconfigs will be:\n<code>%%Y-%%m-%%d_{sequence_index:05d}_{script_basename}</code>\nbut if not present in labconfig files, <code>{sequence_timestamp}_{script_basename}</code>\nwill be used, to preserve the present behaviour of using the sequence id. This is necessary to not modify existing setups since the setting did not exist already.</p>\n<p>For compatibility with lyse (which uses it to index the dataframe), the <code>sequence_id</code> is still saved to the h5 file, but other attributes are saved too. These are:</p>\n<p>'script_basename': the basename of the script, i.e. myscript</p>\n<p>'sequence_date': a string of the date only, i.e. 2019-03-14</p>\n<p>'sequence_index': the sequence_index as an integer,</p>\n<p>'sequence_id': the sequence_id, i.e. 20190314183955_myscript</p>\n<p>The idea is that <code>script_basename</code>, <code>sequence_date</code> and <code>sequence_index</code> become an\nalternative to <code>sequence_id</code> as a way of uniquely identifying a sequence. lyse\nalready has a labconfig setting where it uses the <code>sequence_index</code> if present to\nindex the dataframe (added for the  sake of Spielman fork shots which already\nhave <code>sequence_index</code>), but it has the issue that sequences cannot be fully uniquely\ndetermined by that alone since the date and script name are needed too. So\nthe date and script name are added to the attrs for this purpose, but <code>sequence_id</code>\nis retained for now, perhaps indefinitely since it also provides a timestamp for when the sequence was compiled. It is still useful even if it is not used in filenames or by lyse.</p>\n<p>Refactored runmanager functions to achieve this. There is now a fairly monolithic function\nnew_sequence_details(), which returns the attrs, folder and filepath prefix for\nthe given labconfig settings and current time. It's all in one function because\nthe different pieces all use timestamps, and so to avoid races it either has to be\na single function call or the caller would need to carry around a datetime object.\nSince it is not too complicated I made it a single function call, though the callers\nare often ignoring one or more of its return values.</p>\n<p>Removed generate_sequence_id, since the functions that accept a sequence_id\nnow accept the sequence_attrs dict instead (one entry of which is the sequence_id).\nThis and the modifying of other function call signatures is a backward incompatible\nchange in the sense of the API that runmanager exposes, but is backward-compatible\nwith how other labscript programs use the runmanager API, i.e. BLACS. So I think\nthis is acceptable - code using the runmanager API directly may need to change.\nWe could do a major version bump to indicate this.</p>", "type": "rendered"}, "source": {"commit": {"hash":
