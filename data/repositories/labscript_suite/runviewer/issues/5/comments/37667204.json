Possibly you'd need to hide the markers for the other shots (but there could be a check box next to each shot in the list of shots that says whether to display the markers for that shot, or something along those lines). This idea needs fleshing out some more, but could be a possibility?\n\nThat makes sense with regards to the shutter times. The very first, original version of runviewer, did things like this (although not that exact feature). However, when I rewrote it, I deliberately made the decision to back calculate what was happening from the hardware instructions. This increase the chance that a bug in the code that writes the hardware instructions will be found, since they directly effect what is shown in runviewer. As such, I think it would be preferable to maintain this format, rather than saving additional information that only faithfully represents what is happening if there are no bugs.\n\nThat said, I'm happy to have my mind changed about this. I kind of made the decision by myself at the time, so there has not really been a discussion on the merits of this approach with anyone!\n\nYour plan for pull requests looks good!
