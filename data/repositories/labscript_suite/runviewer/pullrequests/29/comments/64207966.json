It seems like now, when changing which markers are displayed, the plots go back to linear time, whereas before (I think) they were remaining nonlinear. I don't know which behaviour is better, it's probably most sensible to just reset to linear time. The x-axis labels weren't being drawn back in in this case, but that should be easy to fix.\n\nOh, I see what you mean about the markers moving up and down, the labels get out of alignment!
