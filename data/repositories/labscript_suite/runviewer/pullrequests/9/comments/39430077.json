This slipped in and I'll change it back. We did this to allow for smaller plot  and even smaller plots for digital outputs(also changed the ticks 1 to Hi and 0 to Lo) in our implementation. The labels quickly became bigger than the plots themselves and thats why we moved them.\n2. Well not really as there is now a tool tip when moving the mouse over the plot with the current time\n3. addLine does nothing but create a InfiniteLine and add it to the plot([see doc](http://www.pyqtgraph.org/documentation/graphicsItems/plotitem.html)). So I guess I'm already using InfiniteLine\n4. This must have slipped in from our Implementation. We disabled y axis because we use runviewer mostly to check if timing in right and not the y-values. If it's a dealbreaker to rightclick and reenable y-axis for plots that need it I can change it back.\n5. Yes multiple Plots are possible. If you load shots with different markers they are all treated in the same way.\n6. They get overwritten. I didn't think of this case as we only view one shot at a time in our lab(because of nonlinear time). I'll think about how this can be done in a good way without having duplicates of the same label.\n7. Sounds good but not sure how to do this in a way that keeps them aligned with everything else.
