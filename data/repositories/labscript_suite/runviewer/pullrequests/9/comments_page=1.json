Note that I have only been looking at the tip of this branch, as it seemed nontrivial to merge in the newer updates in the default branch.\nA few suggestions before this is merged in:\n\n* The y-axis scaling is turned off by default. Given that your lab likes to have this disabled, perhaps it would be convenient to have a button at the top of the interface which can switch y-scaling on and off globally. For ease of use, this should be set so that it overrides the current values if individual graphs have been manually enabled/disabled, rather than just inverting the current state.\n* When scaling the y-axis of the top figure, I got a little confused at first, as there is no clear border between the region at the top with the labels, and the plotting region. This could be made more pleasing to the eye by either\n    * Adding whitespace below the marker label region about the same size as the vertical gap between graphs, including a break in the marker lines (my preferred option)\n    * shading the top marker label region grey\n    * or adding a horizontal line across bottom of the marker label region.\n* The vertical line in the marker label region where the y-axis would be doesn't quite line up with the other y-axes.
