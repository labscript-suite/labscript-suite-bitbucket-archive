The connection table needs to be sorted from parent devices to child devices, as the initialisation of child devices requires\nthat the parents already be initialised. At the moment the table is sorted alphabetically, so I'll make it sort by device 'generation' first, then alphabetically.\nThis sorting is important so that a trivial change in code doesn't result in the connection table being different.
